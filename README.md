# Todo list application (android)

Serves as a skeleton app and a showcase of principles and some of frameworks/libraries I like 
to use when developing Android applications. (disregard the fact that a lot
of it is a total overkill for such a simple app like this one)

## Principles/frameworks/libraries

- Clean Architecture
- Test driven development/design
  - JUnit 4
  - Kotest
  - Mockk
- Modularization (screaming architecture) - _low coupling high cohesion_
- Koin - _dependency injection_
- Coroutines + Flow - _asynchronous programming_
- Compose - _UI_
- Explicit API Mode - _forces using visibility modifiers_ 
- Detekt + ktlint - _static code analysis_
